# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various medical attributes. A Logistic Regression model is trained on a dataset of patient information to classify them into two categories: having heart disease or not.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can provide an early prediction of heart disease. By analyzing key medical features, the model can assist medical professionals in identifying patients at risk. We use a classic classification algorithm, Logistic Regression, for this purpose.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `heart.csv`, which contains 1025 records of patient data with 14 medical attributes.
#### Features:
1. `age`: Age of the patient
2. `sex`: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. `cp`: Chest pain type
4. `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
5. `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
8. `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
9. `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. `thal`: Thalassemia (a blood disorder)

#### Target Variable:

- `target`: 1 (diseased heart) or 0 (healthy heart)

### Workflow
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
1. **Data Collection & Processing:**
    - Load the dataset using Pandas.
    - Perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure, check for missing values, and view statistical summaries.
    
2. **Feature and Target Splitting:**
    - Separate the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y).

3. **Data Splitting:**
    - Divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.

4. **Model Training:**
    - Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data (`X_train`, `Y_train`).

5. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score on both the training and testing data to check for overfitting.

6. Predictive System:
    - Build a simple system to take new input data and predict whether the patient has heart disease.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy: For numerical operations and creating NumPy arrays.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and loading the CSV file.
- Scikit-learn: For model building, data splitting, and performance evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.

### Model Performance
The trained Logistic Regression model achieved the following accuracy:
- Accuracy on Training Data: 85.24%
- Accuracy on Testing Data: 80.49%

### How to Use
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaonaSarkar/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
3. Install the required dependencies 

          pip install -r requirements.txt
   If you donâ€™t want to use `requirements.txt`, you can manually install:
   
       pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
3. Download the dataset:
    - Ensure the `heart.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    - Open and run the `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
